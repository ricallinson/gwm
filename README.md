# Go Workspace Manager

Super simple workspace manager for the Go programming language.

## Manual Install

For manual install create a folder somewhere in your filesystem with the gwm.sh file inside it. I put mine in a folder called _.gwm_.

Or if you have git installed, then just clone it:

    git clone git@github.com:ricallinson/gwm.git ~/.gwm

To activate gwm, you need to source it from your shell:

    source ~/.gwm/gwm.sh

I always add this line to my _~/.bashrc_, _~/.profile_, or _~/.zshrc_ file to have it automatically sourced upon login.
